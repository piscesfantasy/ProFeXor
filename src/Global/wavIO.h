     WAV File Specification
     FROM http://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/422/projects/WaveFormat/
    The canonical WAVE format starts with the RIFF header:
    0         4   ChunkID          Contains the letters "RIFF" in ASCII form
                                   (0x52494646 big-endian form).
    4         4   ChunkSize        36 + SubChunk2Size, or more precisely:
                                   4 + (8 + SubChunk1Size) + (8 + SubChunk2Size)
                                   This is the size of the rest of the chunk 
                                   following this number.  This is the size of the 
                                   entire file in bytes minus 8 bytes for the
                                   two fields not included in this count:
                                   ChunkID and ChunkSize.
    8         4   Format           Contains the letters "WAVE"
                                   (0x57415645 big-endian form).

    The "WAVE" format consists of two subchunks: "fmt " and "data":
    The "fmt " subchunk describes the sound data's format:
    12        4   Subchunk1ID      Contains the letters "fmt "
                                   (0x666d7420 big-endian form).
    16        4   Subchunk1Size    16 for PCM.  This is the size of the
                                   rest of the Subchunk which follows this number.
    20        2   AudioFormat      PCM = 1 (i.e. Linear quantization)
                                   Values other than 1 indicate some 
                                   form of compression.
    22        2   NumChannels      Mono = 1, Stereo = 2, etc.
    24        4   SampleRate       8000, 44100, etc.
    28        4   ByteRate         == SampleRate * NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8
    32        2   BlockAlign       == NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8
                                   The number of bytes for one sample including
                                   all channels. I wonder what happens when
                                   this number isn't an integer?
    34        2   BitsPerSample    8 bits = 8, 16 bits = 16, etc.

    The "data" subchunk contains the size of the data and the actual sound:
    36        4   Subchunk2ID      Contains the letters "data"
                                   (0x64617461 big-endian form).
    40        4   Subchunk2Size    == NumSamples * NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8
                                   This is the number of bytes in the data.
                                   You can also think of this as the size
                                   of the read of the subchunk following this 
                                   number.
    44        *   Data             The actual sound data.
